"Arise! Awake! And stop not till the goal is reached.

My dear young friends, you have the power within you to shape your destiny. Strength is life, weakness is death. Have faith in yourselves! Believe that nothing is impossible.

Take risks in life. If you win, you can lead; if you lose, you can guide. The world needs fearless soulsâ€”be strong, be pure, and work tirelessly for a noble cause.

Education is not just about gathering information but about building character. Stand up, be bold, and be the change you wish to see. Serve others selflessly, for service to humanity is the highest religion.

The future belongs to those who dare to dream and work hard for it. So, arise, awake, and make your life great!"
